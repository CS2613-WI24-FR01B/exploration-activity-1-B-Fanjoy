# Exploring NumPy

## 1. Which package/library did you select?
I selected the NumPy library.

## 2. What is the package/library?
NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and mathematical functions. NumPy's main object is the homogeneous multidimensional array. It is used for numerical computations and data manipulation.

### Purpose:
- NumPy serves the purpose of providing efficient computation and manipulation of numerical data in Python.
- It is widely used in scientific computing, data analysis, machine learning, and various other domains.
- NumPy's array operations are significantly faster than traditional Python lists, making it suitable for handling large datasets.

### How do you use it?
To use NumPy, you first need to import the library:

    import numpy as np

Then, you can create NumPy arrays:

    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

You can also create arrays of zeros, ones, or with specific ranges using functions like:

    zeros_array = np.zeros((3, 3))  # creates a 3x3 array filled with zeros
    ones_array = np.ones((2, 4))    # creates a 2x4 array filled with ones
    range_array = np.arange(1, 10)  # creates an array with values from 1 to 9
    linspace_array = np.linspace(0, 10, num=5)  # creates an array with 5 equally spaced values from 0 to 10
    random_array = np.random.random((2, 2))  # creates a 2x2 array with random values between 0 and 1
    random_normal_array = np.random.randn(3, 3)  # creates a 3x3 array with random values from a normal distribution
    random_int_array = np.random.randint(1, 100, size=(3, 3))  # creates a 3x3 array with random integers between 1 and 100

You can perform various operations on arrays, such as element-wise arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), broadcasting, and vectorized operations:

    arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

    # Element-wise arithmetic operations

        addition = arr1 + arr2
        subtraction = arr1 - arr2
        multiplication = arr1 * arr2
        division = arr1 / arr2

    # Broadcasting and vectorized operations

        scalar_multiply = arr1 * 2
        squared = arr1 ** 2

You can also perform indexing and slicing operations on arrays to access elements or subsets of arrays:

    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

    # Accessing elements

        print(arr[0])   # prints the first element (index 0)
        print(arr[-1])  # prints the last element (index -1)

    # Slicing

        print(arr[1:4])  # prints elements from index 1 to 3 (exclusive)

## 3. What are the functionalities of the package/library?
Here are some snippets of code demonstrating NumPy functionalities:

    import numpy as np

    # Creating arrays

        arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
        print(arr)

    # Array operations

        arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
        arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
        print(arr1 + arr2)

    # Indexing and slicing

        print(arr[2])
        print(arr[1:4])

    # Array manipulation

        arr_reshaped = arr.reshape(5, 1)
        print(arr_reshaped)

    # Linear algebra

        matrix = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
        print(np.dot(matrix, matrix))

    # Statistical functions

        data = np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=1, size=100)
        print(np.mean(data))
        print(np.std(data))

    # Random number generation

        random_numbers = np.random.randint(1, 10, size=(3, 3))
        print(random_numbers)
