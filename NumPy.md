# Exploring NumPy

## 1. Which package/library did you select?
I selected the NumPy library.

## 2. What is the package/library?
[NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python][1][2]. [It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays][3].

### Purpose:
- NumPy provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation, and much more.
- NumPy arrays facilitate advanced mathematical and other types of operations on large numbers of data. Typically, such operations are executed more efficiently and with less code than is possible using Pythonâ€™s built-in sequences.
- NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists. This is because NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.

### How do you use it?
To use NumPy, you first need to import the library:

    import numpy as np

Then, you can create NumPy arrays:

    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

You can also create arrays of zeros, ones, or with specific ranges using functions like:

    zeros_array = np.zeros((3, 3))  # creates a 3x3 array filled with zeros
    ones_array = np.ones((2, 4))    # creates a 2x4 array filled with ones
    range_array = np.arange(1, 10)  # creates an array with values from 1 to 9
    linspace_array = np.linspace(0, 10, num=5)  # creates an array with 5 equally spaced values from 0 to 10
    random_array = np.random.random((2, 2))  # creates a 2x2 array with random values between 0 and 1
    random_normal_array = np.random.randn(3, 3)  # creates a 3x3 array with random values from a normal distribution
    random_int_array = np.random.randint(1, 100, size=(3, 3))  # creates a 3x3 array with random integers between 1 and 100

You can perform various operations on arrays, such as element-wise arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), broadcasting, and vectorized operations:

    arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

    # Element-wise arithmetic operations

        addition = arr1 + arr2
        subtraction = arr1 - arr2
        multiplication = arr1 * arr2
        division = arr1 / arr2

    # Broadcasting and vectorized operations

        scalar_multiply = arr1 * 2
        squared = arr1 ** 2

You can also perform indexing and slicing operations on arrays to access elements or subsets of arrays:

    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

    # Accessing elements

        print(arr[0])   # prints the first element (index 0)
        print(arr[-1])  # prints the last element (index -1)

    # Slicing

        print(arr[1:4])  # prints elements from index 1 to 3 (exclusive)

## 3. What are the functionalities of the package/library?
Here are some snippets of code demonstrating NumPy functionalities:

    import numpy as np

    # Creating arrays

        arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
        print(arr)

    # Array operations

        arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
        arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
        print(arr1 + arr2)

    # Indexing and slicing

        print(arr[2])
        print(arr[1:4])

    # Array manipulation

        arr_reshaped = arr.reshape(5, 1)
        print(arr_reshaped)

    # Linear algebra

        matrix = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
        print(np.dot(matrix, matrix))

    # Statistical functions

        data = np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=1, size=100)
        print(np.mean(data))
        print(np.std(data))

    # Random number generation

        random_numbers = np.random.randint(1, 10, size=(3, 3))
        print(random_numbers)

## 4. When was it created?
NumPy was created in [2005](https://numpy.org/about/#:~:text=NumPy%20is%20an%20open%20source,the%20Numeric%20and%20Numarray%20libraries.).

## 5. Why did you select this package/library?
